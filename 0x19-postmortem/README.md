## Postmortem: Outage of Smart Todo Application with ChatGPT Integration

### Issue Summary

**Duration of the outage:**  
Start: June 9, 2024, 14:00 UTC  
End: June 9, 2024, 16:30 UTC  

**Impact:**  
The Smart Todo Application with ChatGPT Integration was completely unavailable for 2.5 hours. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in frustration and disruption of daily task management. Approximately 80% of the user base was affected, with 20% reporting slow response times and the remaining 60% experiencing complete service downtime.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the Nginx server settings, which led to a failure in routing traffic correctly to the backend services, causing the application to be inaccessible.

### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating 100% error rate in the application.
- **14:05 UTC:** Engineering team notified via Slack.
- **14:10 UTC:** Initial investigation started; logs reviewed for backend services.
- **14:25 UTC:** Assumption made that the issue was related to recent code deployment; rollback initiated.
- **14:45 UTC:** Rollback completed, but the issue persisted.
- **15:00 UTC:** Misleading investigation path: assumed database outage; database team contacted.
- **15:15 UTC:** Database team confirmed no issues on their end.
- **15:30 UTC:** Escalated to the DevOps team for further investigation.
- **15:40 UTC:** DevOps team identified Nginx configuration error.
- **15:50 UTC:** Correct Nginx configuration applied.
- **16:00 UTC:** Application started to recover.
- **16:30 UTC:** Full service restored; monitoring confirmed normal operation.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the Nginx server settings. Specifically, a recent update to the Nginx configuration file inadvertently included a syntax error, which caused the server to fail in properly routing traffic to the backend services. This misconfiguration resulted in a 502 Bad Gateway error for users trying to access the application.

**Resolution:**  
The issue was resolved by identifying and correcting the Nginx configuration error. The DevOps team reviewed the Nginx configuration file and pinpointed the syntax error. Once the correct configuration was applied, Nginx was restarted, and the application began routing traffic correctly. Full service was restored, and monitoring confirmed that the application was operating normally.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**

1. **Configuration Management:**  
   - Implement a stricter review process for configuration changes.
   - Use automated syntax checking tools for configuration files before deployment.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts:**  
   - Enhance monitoring to include specific alerts for Nginx configuration issues.
   - Implement end-to-end transaction monitoring to detect routing issues more quickly.

3. **Incident Response:**  
   - Improve the incident response plan to include a detailed checklist for common misconfiguration issues.
   - Conduct regular training for the engineering team on troubleshooting and incident management.

**TODO List:**

1. Patch Nginx server configuration:
   - [ ] Review and update Nginx configuration files.
   - [ ] Implement automated syntax checking in the CI/CD pipeline.
   
2. Improve monitoring and alerting:
   - [ ] Add specific Nginx configuration error alerts.
   - [ ] Implement end-to-end transaction monitoring.

3. Enhance incident response plan:
   - [ ] Develop a comprehensive checklist for configuration-related issues.
   - [ ] Schedule regular incident management training for the engineering team.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future and improve our overall system reliability and response time.
