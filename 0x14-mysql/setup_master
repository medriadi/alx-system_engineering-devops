**Primary (Master) Server Setup**

1. **Open the MySQL configuration file for editing:**

```
sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
```

2. **Add the following lines to the `[mysqld]` section:**

```
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_do_db = tyrell_corp
```

- `server-id`: A unique identifier for the MySQL server instance (in this case, set to 1 for the primary server).
- `log_bin`: Enables binary logging, which is required for replication.
- `binlog_do_db`: Configures MySQL to only log updates for the specified database (in this case, `tyrell_corp`).

3. **Save the changes and exit the text editor.**

4. **Restart the MySQL service for the changes to take effect:**

```
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

5. **Connect to the MySQL server as the root user:**

```
mysql -u root -p
```

6. **Create a user account for the replica to connect to the primary:**

```sql
CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Replace `'replica_user'` with the desired username and `'your_secure_password'` with a secure password.

7. **Verify the primary server's binary log file name and position:**

```sql
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

Take note of the `File` and `Position` values, as you'll need them when configuring the replica.

8. **Exit the MySQL prompt:**

```sql
EXIT;
```

9. **Secure the MySQL server:**

On the `web-01` server, configure UFW to allow incoming connections on port 3306 (default MySQL port):

```
sudo ufw allow from replica_server_ip to any port 3306
```
